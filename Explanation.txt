You are given with a positve number n and a target number, we have to perform in form of n (operation) n ......
and we have to get the target, the operation may be addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
When writing such an expression, we adhere to the following conventions:
The division operator (/) returns rational numbers.
There are no parentheses placed anywhere.
We use the usual order of operations: multiplication and division happens before addition and subtraction.
It's not allowed to use the unary negation operator (-).  For example, "n - n" is a valid expression as it only uses subtraction, but "-n + n" is not because it uses negation.
We would like to write an expression with the least number of operators such that the expression equals the given target.  Return the least number of operators used

Input Description:
Two integers, n and target. (1<n,target<1000)

Output Description:
Print the least number of operators used
